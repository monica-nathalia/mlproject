Try to make changes to the branch rather than master!

to make changes in branches:

```git checkout question2```
```git checkout question3```
```git checkout question4```
```git checkout challenge-question```

commit changes to the branch rather than master first:
```git add <your file name>```

```git commit -m "<insert message here>"```

```git push```

let git find any issues, and then we'll do pull requests/merge.
